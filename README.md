# Udacity Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree

The [Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization-with-power-BI-nanodegree--nd331) Nanodegree Program by Udacity will equip any learner who wants to develop in-demand skills in data pre-processing, visualization, and analysis using Microsoft Power BI as the primary tool. Students in this program will learn to connect Microsoft Power BI to multiple data sources, process and transform data to prepare it for reporting and visualization, build compelling data visualizations that tell a story and employ best design practices, and draw insights from data dashboards and visualizations that can allow for insights and help a business make critical decisions.

# Program Syllabus

## COURSE 1: Introduction to Preparing & Modeling Data

In a perfect world, every BI professional would be provided with pristine data warehouse and enterprise level data models to easily build and deploy reliable data models themselves—but that isn’t reality. Often, the data they need for a single report
lives in a bunch of different files and software systems. This is where preparing and modeling data becomes essential. This course is a crucial step in Microsoft Power BI for anyone who needs to mash together multiple data sources, clean them, restructure them, and harmonize them into a single and efficient data model to support reporting. We’ll cover Microsoft Power BI’s built-in `Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)` tool: `Power Query`, learn foundational data modeling principles, cover some introductory `DAX (data analytics expressions)`, and touch on troubleshooting and optimization. Each of these steps creates
the foundation for beautiful reports and efficient DAX, ideally positioning learners to take on the remaining courses in the Nanodegree program.

### Project 1 - Build a Data Model for Seven Sages Brewing Company 
Create a data model and Microsoft Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing, a small company struggling to leverage their disjointed data to facilitate smart decision-making. The mission is to tame their datasets and create an efficient data model that will help the company better understand what products are popular—and profitable—so they can mark smart decisions about what products to prioritize as the company continues to grow. Learners will demonstrate an understanding of core data modeling principles, including the ability to clean, organize, and structure data in Power Query. They will also make data tables,
build a data model with the appropriate relationships and filters, and create a simple report using common visualizations and DAX measures.

## COURSE 2: Creating Visualizations with Microsoft Power BI

Learn how to carry Microsoft Power BI beyond mere bar charts and transform reports into data exploration and storytelling tools that companies can use to better understand their data. Students will start by learning about a variety of common and more advanced data visualizations, ranging from bar charts and line charts to scatter plots and bubble maps. Then, students will learn how to design reports around these data visuals in order to focus user attention on key insights, help users navigate different features and report pages, and enable accessibility options for diverse audiences. Next, the student will learn how to use filters and slicers to make the Microsoft Power BI tools they develop more interactive and encourage users to explore datasets and visuals. Finally, students will deliver a couple of advanced features capable of elevating user navigation and
engagement with visuals and the report itself. 

### Project 2 - Building a Power BI report for Waggle

Waggle is a hot new startup that produces smart devices for pets. Their leading product, the Lapdog collar, has been a tremendous success for the company and it allows a pet owner to easily track their dog’s steps, heart rate, and general health from the convenience of their phone. The product has been so successful, in fact, that the company is considering releasing a similar product for cats called Lapcat and has been testing hundreds of prototypes in the field for the past several months. Now, the data from those tests has been compiled and Waggle leadership has requested a Microsoft Power BI report that summarizes key insights comparing Lapcat and Lapdog devices that can be presented
to the CEO. This project will test learners on the data visualization and report design skills learned in the course while also challenging them to implement a variety of interactive features that can enhance the user experience. By the end of the project, learners will have designed a detailed Microsoft Power BI report with many data visuals that tell the story of how the new Lapcat devices compared to Lapdog collars.

## COURSE 3: Advanced Data Analysis

In this course, learners will focus on the techniques and skills needed for data analysis in Microsoft Power BI. The course is centered around building a strong foundation and intuition of analytics so that learners can take their skills beyond simply aggregating data in Microsoft Power BI and into the realm of `statistics`, `forecasting`, and `strategy`. We first start with an introduction to data analysis looking at different terms and techniques such as `descriptive` and `inferential statistics`, `histograms`, `linear regression`, and an introduction to the concepts of `correlation and probability`. After taking the introductory lessons on data analytics, the course then moves to `M`, the language of Power Query, and learning to build custom formulas as part of the data transformation process. In this section, the syntax of the language is explored and learners are challenged with different exercises to build their familiarity and skills. After Power Query, the course then moves to `DAX`. In a similar approach, the syntax of the language is reviewed along with common functions and exercises to build an intuition for analyzing data with `DAX`. The final lesson of the course goes through a number of visualizations in Microsoft Power BI and explores how those visuals may be used, edited or enhanced to effectively relay information to an audience. The overarching goal of the course is to help learners become effective at the process of retrieving, analyzing and visualizing data in order to answer questions and draw conclusions.

### Project 3 - Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain

An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they don’t know who to target. They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer. In this project, learners will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two. Through this project, learners will demonstrate the ability to use custom M code to import, clean, format, and organize data in Power Query and use custom DAX code to analyze data in Microsoft Power BI. Learners will also conduct statistical analysis to understand relationships and probabilities of the data sources, including linear regression, histogram, and standard deviation, and create advanced visualizations to present conclusions and recommendations that are driven by the statistical analysis.
